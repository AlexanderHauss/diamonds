            <p class="articles">The Customer may choose between delivery to a collection point or delivery to his/her home by Colissimo (served by la Poste, the French postal system, in mainland France) or a specialised shipping company for international orders.</p>
            <p class="articles">After validating these delivery methods and before the order has been released for payment, the website <a href="maroquinerie/sac-a-bandoulieres.html">www.mysuelly.com</a> shall issue an order summary, listing the mode of transport for which the products in question are eligible in accordance with the option selected by the Customer from the options proposed. The cost of the modes of transport affected or selected will therefore be indicated before the order is released for payment.</p>
            <p class="articles">When the order has duly been prepared and is ready for dispatch, the Customer will receive an email concerning the dispatch of each part of the order via the mode of transport agreed.</p>
            <p class="articles">&nbsp;&nbsp;&rArr;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><u>Delivery to collection point:</u></em><br>For Customers who select the &ldquo;Collection point&rdquo; option, MYSUELLY will provide a list of the name and addresses of those professionals offering these services closest to the delivery address chosen. In this case, the Customer will be able to check the opening times and days of the selected collection point.<br>Once the order has arrived at the collection point, the Customer will have 14 calendar days to collect the parcel(s). Otherwise, the order will be returned to MYSUELLY, which will contact the Customer via email to arrange another delivery at the Customer&rsquo;s expense. In the absence of a reply within 7 days of this email, MYSUELLY will consider the Customer as having exercised his/her right of return and will proceed with a refund based on the conditions set forth concerning the exercising of the right of withdrawal (cf. Article 6-1 in the present GTC).</p>
            <p class="articles">&nbsp;&nbsp;&rArr;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><u>Delivery by Colissimo:</u></em><br>Delivery by Colissimo is a service offered by French post offices and is subject to their own General Terms and Conditions of Use. If the Customer is not at home and it is not possible to leave the parcel with a caretaker, the Customer will receive a notice of non-delivery. He/She will then have 14 days to go and retrieve the parcel from the post office indicated on the notice. Otherwise, the order will be returned to MYSUELLY, which will contact the Customer via email to arrange another delivery at the Customer&rsquo;s expense. In the absence of a reply within 7 days of this email, MYSUELLY will consider the Customer as having exercised his/her right of return and will proceed with a refund based on the conditions set forth concerning the exercising of the right of withdrawal (cf. Article 6-1 in the present GTC).</p>
            <p class="articles">Should there be any problem with the delivery, the Customer should write down any concerns on the dispatch note provided by the shipper. For all practical purposes, it should be noted that concerns expressed by the Customer serve to confirm the presence and the significance of any damage at the time of or during delivery. The Customer must indicate his/her concerns in the form of handwritten, detailed, dated, explicit observations that are accompanied by a signature on the delivery note in order for these to be admissible.</p>
            <p class="articles">These problems may include, for example:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;Product worn: scratches, dents, bumps, etc.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;Product non-compliant (incorrect reference, colour, etc.) or incorrect quantity.</p>
            <p class="articles">However, simply adding wording such as &ldquo;unpacked&rdquo; or &ldquo;damaged&rdquo; is not sufficient to cover the Customer with regard to the warranty if the product has been unpacked and does not allow damage to be confirmed.</p>
            
            <p class="under_title">5.6 DELIVERY CHARGES</p>
            <p class="articles">Transportation charges are calculated on the basis of both the destination and the weight of the parcel.<br>The rates indicated are listed in euros (&euro;) and include all taxes and charges, including the applicable VAT at the rate in force on the day of delivery.</p>
            <p class="articles">When a product is added to the basket, the charges are calculated automatically based on delivery to mainland France. The Customer can freely check the charges and the shipper associated with his/her products.</p>

            <p class="under_title">6.1. CONDITIONS CONCERNING THE EXERCISING OF THE RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL</p>
            <p class="articles">&nbsp;&nbsp;&rArr;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><u>Notice period</u></em><br />In line with the provisions set forth in Article L. 121-21 of the French Consumer Code, the Customer has a notice period of 14 days to exercise his/her right of withdrawal without needing to state any reason. This period shall commence the day the order is received. In the case of an order involving multiple goods delivered separately or an order for a product composed of multiple pieces, the delivery of which is  staggered over a defined period, the notice period will commence from the date the last product or piece is delivered. For contracts involving the regular delivery of products over a defined period, the notice period will begin from the date on which the first product is received.</p>
            <p class="articles">&nbsp;&nbsp;&rArr;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><u>Exercising the right of withdrawal</u></em><br />In order to exercise his/her right of withdrawal, the Customer must  inform MYSUELLY of his/her decision to do so by submitting the withdrawal form provided before the 14-day notice period comes to an end. This form will have been sent to the Customer along with the order confirmation email (and a copy is included as an Appendix to the present GTC), or any other unambiguous declaration expressing his/her wish to withdraw. MYSUELLY also allows the Customer to withdraw online by logging into his/her personal section of the website in the &ldquo;My Account&rdquo; area.</p>
            <p class="articles">&nbsp;&nbsp;&rArr;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><u>Loss of the right of withdrawal</u></em><br />As outlined in Article L 121-21-8 of the French Consumer Code, it should be noted that the right of withdrawal cannot be used for contracts concerning the following: 1&deg; The provision of services provided fully before the end of the withdrawal period and the provision of which commenced following a prior express agreement with the Customer, expressly renouncing his right of withdrawal;</p>
            <p class="articles">2&deg; The provision of goods or services the prices of which depend on fluctuations on the financial market and are beyond the control of the professional and  likely to change during the withdrawal period;</p>
            <p class="articles">3&deg; The provision of goods produced on the basis of customer specifications or clearly personalised goods;</p>
            <p class="articles">4&deg; The provision of goods likely to deteriorate or expire quickly;</p>
            <p class="articles">5&deg; The provision of goods that have been unsealed by the Customer after delivery and which cannot be returned for hygiene or health reasons;</p>
            <p class="articles">6&deg; The provision of goods which, by their nature, are combined following delivery with other items such that they cannot be separated ;</p>
            <p class="articles">7&deg; The provision of alcoholic drinks, the delivery of which is delayed by over thirty days and the value of which arranged upon conclusion of the contract depends on market fluctuations that are beyond the control of the professional;</p>
            <p class="articles">8&deg; Urgent maintenance or repair works to the home of the Customer and expressly requested by him/her, limited to spare parts and work that is strictly necessary to respond to the urgency;</p>
            <p class="articles">9&deg; The provision of audio or video recordings or of computer software if these have been opened by the Customer following delivery;</p>
            <p class="articles">10&deg; The provision of a newspaper, periodical or magazine, with the exception of subscriptions to these ;</p>
            <p class="articles">11&deg; Agreements concluded at public auctions;</p>
            <p class="articles">12&deg; The provision of services concerning accommodation, other than residential accommodation, goods transportation services, car rental services, catering services or services concerning leisure activities that must be provided on a specific date or within a specific period;</p>
            <p class="articles">13&deg; The provision of digital content not supplied on a hardware device, the execution of which has commenced following a prior agreement with the Customer, expressly renouncing his right of withdrawal.</p>
            <p class="articles">&nbsp;&nbsp;&rArr;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><u>Condition concerning the condition of the product</u></em><br />In order for the Customer to be able to exercise this right of withdrawal, the product returned must be in a such a condition that will allow it to be resold immediately. The product must therefore be returned in as-new condition, along with the various notices and accessories delivered with it, and in its original packaging. MYSUELLY reserves the right to refuse a refund for a product if all of these conditions have not been fulfilled.</p>
            <p class="articles">&nbsp;&nbsp;&rArr;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><u>Reimbursement methods</u></em><br />Should the Customer choose to exercise his/her right of withdrawal within the aforementioned notice period, and in line with the provisions set forth in Article L121-21-4 of the French Consumer Code, MYSUELLY shall reimburse the Customer within 14 calendar days from the date on which the Customer informs MYSUELLY of his/her decision to withdraw<br />However, MYSUELLY reserves the right to delay the reimbursement until the goods have been recovered or until the Customer has provided proof of dispatch of these goods, the date selected being the first of these two events.<br />The refund shall always be based on the sums effectively paid by the Customer, as indicated on the invoice. Nevertheless, MYSUELLY reserves the right to refuse to refund the additional shipping costs incurred as a result of a more costly shipping method chosen expressly by the Customer despite MYSUELLY&rsquo;s proposal of a standard delivery method.<br />The shipping costs to be refunded shall be determined as if the customer had never purchased the product(s) returned.<br />Finally, in principle and unless the Customer expressly requests otherwise, MYSUELLY shall proceed with refunding the latter by means of the payment method used during payment. In the case of a material impossibility preventing the use of this method, MYSUELLY shall propose sending a cheque for the amount due to the Customer by post.</p>
            <p class="articles">&nbsp;&nbsp;&rArr;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><u>Liability for shipping costs for return delivery</u></em><br />The Customer  shall be expressly liable for the costs of the return delivery and acknowledges and accepts this liability by complying with the present General Terms and Conditions of Sale.<br />Nonetheless, by way of derogation from this principle, MYSUELLY will be able to take charge of product returns deposited by the Customer at a collection point or shipped by Colissimo in accordance with the terms indicated above as part of a commercial offering if desired.</p>
